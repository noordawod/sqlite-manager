SQLite Manager
==============

This library sweetens your migrations for SQLite databases.

Features include:

* Uses the Application's context directly (no need to supply Context anymore);
* A simple yet powerful schema upgrade/downgrade plan;
* A simple handler to manage progress and completion of the plans.
